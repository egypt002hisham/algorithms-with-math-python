# Degree in Graph Theory

In graph theory, a **vertex** represents a point or node, and an **edge** is a connection between two vertices. The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.

- If a vertex is connected to itself (a loop), that loop counts as **2** towards the degree.
- The **higher the degree**, the more connections the vertex has.

## Why is degree useful?

- It helps measure how **connected or central** a vertex is in a graph.
- High-degree vertices often represent **critical points** in networks (e.g., influential users in social networks).
- Many algorithms use degree to **optimize performance** or **analyze structure** (e.g., shortest path, clustering).

## Examples

- A vertex with 3 connections has degree 3.
- A vertex with 1 loop has degree 2.
- An isolated vertex has degree 0.

## Visual Tip

Try drawing graphs with paper or code, then:

- Count degrees manually.
- Check for loops or isolated nodes.

This builds strong intuition for how algorithms interact with graph structure.
