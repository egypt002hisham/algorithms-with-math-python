# Russian Peasants Algorithm Explanation

## Overview

The **Russian Peasants Algorithm** is a method to compute the product of two numbers without directly using multiplication. It uses the concepts of halving and doubling, combined with binary operations.

## Code Explanation

### Russian_Peasants_Algorithm(a, b)

This function computes the product of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Russian Peasants Algorithm.

```python
def Russian_Peasants_Algorithm(a, b):
    x = a  # Store the first number (a) in variable x
    y = b  # Store the second number (b) in variable y
    z = 0  # Initialize z to store the result

    while x > 0:  # Continue until x becomes 0
        if x % 2 == 1:  # If x is odd
            z = y + z  # Add y to the result z

        y = y << 1  # Double y (left shift)
        x = x >> 1  # Halve x (right shift)

    return z  # Return the final result z
```

# Explanation of the `binary` Function

The `binary` function demonstrates basic binary operations using bit shifts. Specifically, it divides a number by 2 and multiplies another number by 2, using the right and left shift operations respectively. These operations are commonly used in binary arithmetic for efficient calculations.

## Function Definition

```python
def binary(n, m):
    n = n >> 1  # Divide n by 2 (right shift)
    m = m << 1  # Multiply m by 2 (left shift)
    return n, m  # Return the updated values
```
